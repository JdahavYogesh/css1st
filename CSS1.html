    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS Class applies a style to mmultiple element, ID on the other hand , applies a style to the one unique element .ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
    
    <p>In CSS, slectores are used to target a spexify element or range of element on a web page Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
    
    <p>Ther is a wide range of selectors available. two of the most commonly used are class and ID, both used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
